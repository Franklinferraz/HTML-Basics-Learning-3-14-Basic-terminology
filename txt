Basic terminology

To learn more HTML, we should learn how to talk about HTML. 
Already you have seen we use <>s a lot.

Things inside <>s are called tags.
Tags nearly always come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.
Example of opening tag: <html>
Example of closing tag: </html>
You can think of tags as being like parentheses: 
whenever you open one, you should close it. 
Tags also nest, so you should close them in the right order: 
the most recently opened tag should be the first one closed, 
like in the example below.

<first tag><second tag>Some text!</second tag></first tag>

The last exercise taught us how to set up our HTML file. 
Everything we do now will go between <html> and </html>.

Practice makes perfect! One more time:

Instructions
Put in the <!DOCTYPE HTML> tag.
Put in the <html> opening and closing tags.
Between the <html> tags, write whatever you like.
Press Save & Submit Code to see what you've written appear on the page!

Hint
Feel free to peek back at earlier exercises if you forget exactly what a tag looks like.
